# The statistical and dynamic modeling of protests in Ukraine: the revolution of dignity and preceding times.

In this repository, we present the code used to generate the figures and fitting models to desribe the Euromaidan protests that happened in 2013. We uise data provided from the Center for Social and Labor Research https://www.cslr.org.ua/en/pro-nas/page/3/ . We use different configurations of Hawkes processes and statistical analysis to derive best fitting model.
